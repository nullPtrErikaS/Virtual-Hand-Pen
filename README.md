# Virtual Hand Pen Project

## Introduction
The Virtual Hand Pen Project is an application that utilizes advanced hand-tracking technology and allows users to draw and write with their hands in the air, capturing their movements and translating them into digital strokes on a virtual canvas. This system uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe for robust hand recognition and real-time drawing capabilities.

## Features
- **Hand Tracking**: Real-time hand movement tracking to accurately capture drawing gestures.
- **Virtual Drawing**: Users can draw on any surface, which the system replicates on a virtual canvas.
- **Customizable Settings**: Dynamically adjust sensitivity and color.
- **Gesture Controls**: Implement gestures to erase, change color, or stop drawing
